I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Operations and Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/) of the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.

Prior to joining Kelley, I was a Postdoctoral Principal Researcher of the [Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu) at the University of Chicago, where I worked closely with Professor [Barış Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). I obtained my Ph.D. in Operations Research from the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial and Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu) at Georgia Institute of Technology, co-advised by Professor [Sigrún Andradóttir](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/sigrun-andradottir) and Professor [Seong-Hee Kim](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/seong-hee-kim). 

My research focuses on developing solutions to operational challenges in public sector applications. I am also interested in simulation modeling and analysis, data-based decision-making, and simulation optimization.
