Hi, I am a postdoctoral principle researcher at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business working with [Dr. Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). Prior to joining Booth, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Operations Research at [Georgia Institute of Technology, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu) under the supervision of [Dr. Sigrun Andradottir](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/sigrun-andradottir) and [Dr. Seong-Hee Kim](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/seong-hee-kim). 

I received my undergraduate degree in both Industrial and System Engineering and Discrete Mathematics from Georgia Institute of Technology.
