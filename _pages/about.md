Hi, I am a postdoctoral principle researcher at the [University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu), working with [Dr. Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Operations Research from [Georgia Institute of Technology, H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu), under the supervision of [Dr. Sigrun Andradottir](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/sigrun-andradottir) and [Dr. Seong-Hee Kim](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/seong-hee-kim). 

My research interests are centered on developing solutions to operational challenges in public sector applications. I am also interested in simulation modeling and analysis, data-based decision-making, and simulation optimization. 

I received my undergraduate degrees in both Industrial and System Engineering and Discrete Mathematics from Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My [CV](https://yuweizhou3.github.io/files/CV_YuweiZhou.pdf) can be downloaded here. 

**I am on the 2023-2024 academic job market.**
