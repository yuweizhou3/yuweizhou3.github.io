I am an Assistant Professor of [Operations and Decision Technologies](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/departments/operations-decision-technologies/) at the Kelley School of Business, Indiana University.

Prior to joining Kelley, I was a Postdoctoral Principal Researcher at the [University of Chicago Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu), where I worked closely with Professor [Baris Ata](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/a/baris-ata). I obtained my Ph.D. in Operations Research from the [H. Milton Stewart School of Industrial & Systems Engineering](https://www.isye.gatech.edu) at Georgia Institute of Technology, under the guidance of Professor [Sigrun Andrad√≥ttir](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/sigrun-andradottir) and Professor [Seong-Hee Kim](https://www.isye.gatech.edu/users/seong-hee-kim). Previously, I received my undergraduate degrees in both Industrial and System Engineering and Discrete Mathematics from Georgia Institute of Technology. 

My research focuses on developing solutions to operational challenges in public sector applications. I am also interested in simulation modeling and analysis, data-based decision-making, and simulation optimization.
